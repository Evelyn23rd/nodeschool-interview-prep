# Course overview

This course is geared towards helping bootcamp grads and self-taught learners to prepare for the technical programming interview. It's based on what I know from interviewing at numerous startups and being an interviewer at three software startups. There isn't nearly enough time to cover computer science fundamentals in depth — it can take years of college courses to do that. The goals of the course are to:

1. Give **a roadmap on how to prepare** for the technical interview
2. Give an introduction to **important CS concepts**
3. Give students a chance to **practice solving algorithms questions** with each other

The curriculum will consist of 4 sessions. Each session, I'll talk for about an hour about topics like CS theory, testing, or behavioral questions. Then we'll use the rest of the time to have people get live practice answering algorithms questions, so they can get hands-on experience with whiteboarding and explaining their thought process.

⚠️All material is preliminary and subject to change after trying it out IRL. The whiteboarding practice format is something that may or may not work, and can be adjusted as needed.

**Session 1 — Overview of the Interview Process & Technical Phone Screen Practice**

Overview of interview process [50 min]: 

- We'll cover the different stages of an interview process  — preparation before an interview, the technical phone screen, take-home challenges, and the onsite.
- Behavioral questions: Having good answers to behavioral questions is important. Know what you should have an answer for, and also what questions to ask your interviewer.
- Side projects: We'll cover why side projects are helpful for standing out and also for being able to answer certain behavioral questions well.

Technical phone screen practice [60+ min]:

- Folks will group into pairs, and each reads the question and solution to one of two different technical screening questions. Then, they take turns being interviewer and interviewee, with the interviewee trying to solve it by coding up a solution on their computer while the other person observes with the solution in hand.
⚠️Tentative format, may be adjusted.
- I'll review the answers, showing how I would code it up on a TV.

**Session 2 — CS Fundamentals (Part 1) & Whiteboarding Practice (Part 1)**

CS fundamentals [50 min]: Cover data structures like strings, arrays, stacks, queues, sets, and hash tables. Implement one of them. Talk about when you would use each one.

Whiteboarding practice [60+ min]:

- Folks will group into pairs, and each reads the question and solution to one of two different whiteboarding algorithm questions. Then, each person take turns being interviewer and interviewee, with the interviewee trying to solve it by writing up a solution on the whiteboard while the other person observes with the solution in hand. If anyone has questions or wants to be coached, I'll be around to help with that.
⚠️Tentative format, may be adjusted.
- I'll review the answers, showing how I would whiteboard the answer. We can also talk about how to approach it if you don't know the answer.

**Session 3 — CS Fundamentals (Part 2) & Whiteboarding Practice (Part 2)**

CS Fundamentals [40 min]: Recursion. Big O notation (runtime and space).

Whiteboarding practice [60+ min]: Same format as in session 2.

**Session 4 — Testing & CS Fundamentals (Part 3)**

Testing [40 min]: I'll show how I would approach unit testing a typical javascript/node function that could show up in an interview, asking people about what edge cases they would consider. This can also cover more real-world node app testing, with mocking. Then I'll ask folks to unit test another example function.

CS Fundamentals [60 min]: Trees and tree traversal, graphs and graph search (breadth-first, depth-first).
