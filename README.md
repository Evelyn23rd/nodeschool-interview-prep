# NodeSchool Interview Prep

This course is geared towards helping bootcamp grads and self-taught learners to prepare for the technical programming interview. It's based on what I know from interviewing at numerous startups and being an interviewer at three software startups. There isn't nearly enough time to cover computer science fundamentals in depth â€” it can take years of college courses to do that. The goals of the course are to:

1. Give **a roadmap on how to prepare** for the technical interview
2. Give an introduction to **important CS concepts**
3. Give students a chance to **practice solving algorithms questions** with each other

The curriculum will consist of 4 sessions. Each session, I'll talk for about an hour about topics like CS theory, testing, or behavioral questions. Then we'll use the rest of the time to have people get live practice answering algorithms questions, so they can get hands-on experience with whiteboarding and explaining their thought process.
